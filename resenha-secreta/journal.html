    You know, I am not really sure what to type in here, but my dad has taken a bit of a break from writing this, and
    as I am writing this, I would like you to go on and make sure you are
    safe and take care of yourself. You are quite loved, and you should
    always make sure you look out for yourself and love yourself. You may
    not feel like it, but you should do that. I am not sure if you're still
    reading this, but if you are, I appreciate that a lot. You are an amazing
    person, and you deserve to be happy. If you ever feel sad, make sure
    you are safe and take care of yourself. You are quite loved, and you
    should always make sure you look out for yourself and love yourself.
    You may not feel like it, but you should do that. I am not sure if you're
    still reading this, but if you are, I appreciate that a lot. You are an
    amazing person, and you deserve to be happy. If you ever feel sad, 
    make sure to find someone you trust to talk with, but if you dont like
    talking to someone, thats completely okay too. I completely respect
    that, and I hope you stay safe and take care.
